# Tiering, Escalation, and SLA Policy 
This document defines the tier structure, escalation triggers, and 
service expectations for the AI Help Desk. 
## 1. Support Tiers - **Tier 0 – Self-Service AI** - AI Help Desk resolves issues using KB and guided flows. - No human agent involvement. - **Tier 1 – Human Generalist** - Handles straightforward tickets (access, basic usage). - **Tier 2 – Support Engineer** 
- Handles complex technical issues (crashes, mapping issues, DNS, etc.). - **Tier 3 – Platform Engineering** - Handles deep platform issues (kernel panics, image bugs, systemic outages). 
## 2. Severity Levels - **LOW** – Minor inconvenience, workaround available. - **MEDIUM** – User blocked, but no time-critical impact. - **HIGH** – Multiple users blocked, or key exercise blocked. - **CRITICAL** – Systemic outage, data loss risk, or major training impact. 
## 3. Escalation Rules (Simplified) 
The AI Help Desk must escalate when: 
1. **Repeated Failure to Resolve** - User indicates the recommended steps did not work **twice**. - Same issue persists after documented self-service attempts. 
2. **High or Critical Impact** - Lab crashes during key graded exercises. - Multiple users report identical blocking issue. - Kernel panic, container startup failure that blocks entire module. 
3. **Security-Sensitive Request** - Requests to disable logging. - Requests for host/hypervisor access. - Requests for destructive actions (resetting all environments). 
## 4. Ticket Creation 
When escalation is required, create a ticket with: - Summary (short, descriptive) - Full conversation context - User role and course/module - Tier and severity classification - Any relevant timestamps and error messages 
## 5. AI Help Desk Behavior 
The AI Help Desk: 
- Must not override these rules based on user preference 
(e.g., “don’t escalate this”). - Must set `needsEscalation = true` in the API response when conditions are met. - Must correctly choose tier and severity based on this document.
