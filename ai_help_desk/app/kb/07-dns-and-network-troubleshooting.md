# DNS and Network Troubleshooting 
This document covers **user-facing** DNS and connectivity issues. 
## 1. DNS Resolution Failures 
Symptom: - The lab or browser reports it cannot resolve an internal domain 
(e.g., `*.internal.cyberlab`). 
AI Help Desk Steps: 
1. Ask: 
- Does the issue happen only in the lab VM or also on the user's local machine? - Which URL or hostname are they trying to access? 
2. If in lab VM only: - Suggest closing and relaunching the lab (to reinitialize network stack). - Ask user to confirm whether other internal domains work. 
3. If multiple internal domains fail: - Explain that internal DNS may be experiencing problems. - Escalate to Tier 2. 
## 2. `/etc/hosts` Editing Requests 
Users may ask to modify `/etc/hosts`. 
Policy: - Trainees and Instructors must **never** modify `/etc/hosts` inside lab VMs. - Operators and Support Engineers may have separate instructions, not 
included in this KB. 
AI Help Desk Behavior: - If user asks: "Should I add a hosts entry?" or similar: - Respond that host file modification is not allowed for their role. - Do not provide example entries, IPs, or commands. - If DNS issue appears platform-wide, escalate. 
## 3. VPN and External Connectivity 
CyberLab is primarily designed for controlled environments. 
If connectivity issues stem from user VPN, corporate proxy, or firewall: - Provide documented guidance if present. - Otherwise, recommend: - Trying from a different network if permitted. - Contacting their local IT support for VPN/firewall configuration
