# Virtual Lab Operations and Recovery 
This document describes how to handle issues with personal lab VMs and 
shared ranges. 
## 1. Common Issues - VM freezes / becomes unresponsive. - VM shuts down unexpectedly. - User loses work mid-exercise. - Kernel panic messages appear in the VM console. --- 
## 2. Freeze or Temporary Unresponsiveness 
Symptoms: - UI stops responding. - Mouse/keyboard lag. 
Steps (Tier 0): 
1. Ask the user: - Are other browser tabs responsive? - Are other users reporting similar issues? 
2. If only a single VM is affected: - Instruct user to disconnect and reconnect through the portal. - Do **not** instruct them to reboot the VM from inside the guest OS. 
If the VM remains unresponsive after reconnection, escalate to Tier 2. --- 
## 3. Unexpected Shutdown / Lab Crash 
Symptoms: - VM or lab tab closes abruptly. - "Connection lost" or similar message appears. 
Steps: 
1. Ask: - Which module and lab are they running? - Approximately when did the crash occur? 
2. Check whether the lab supports **auto-snapshot on start**: - If yes: - Instruct user to relaunch the lab. - Inform them that state may be restored from the last snapshot. - If no: - Explain that unsaved in-VM changes may be lost. 
Escalate to Tier 2 if: - The lab repeatedly crashes on relaunch. - Multiple users report crashes in the same module.

## 4. Kernel Panic in Lab VM 
If user reports kernel panic messages (e.g., stack trace, driver-related logs): - Do **not** attempt to debug or instruct user to alter kernel or drivers. - Explain that kernel-level issues are handled by platform engineering. - Immediately escalate to Tier 2 with: - Lab name and module - Time of incident - Any screenshots or logs provided 
The AI Help Desk must never provide OS-level commands to modify drivers, 
kernel modules, or boot parameters. --- 
## 5. Lost Progress 
If a user loses work because of a crash: - Apologize and explain snapshot behavior clearly. - Provide any **documented** recommendations for: - Saving work more frequently - Exporting artifacts (if supported) - Do not promise recovery if snapshots are not configured. 
If recurring, escalate so Support Engineers can investigate the lab image.
