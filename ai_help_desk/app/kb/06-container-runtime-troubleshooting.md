# Container Runtime Troubleshooting 
Some labs run as short-lived containers. This document covers common 
container-related issues. 
## 1. Missing Startup Script (`/opt/startup.sh`) 
Symptom: - Error message: `container init failed: missing /opt/startup.sh` 
Cause: - Lab image was built without the required startup script, or - Deployment pipeline did not mount the script correctly. 
AI Help Desk Steps: 
1. Confirm message with user. 
2. Explain that the issue is caused by a misconfigured lab image. 
3. Instruct user to: - Stop the current lab instance. - Relaunch the lab from the portal once. 
4. If the error persists after a relaunch: - Escalate to Tier 2 with: - Lab name and module - Time of failure - Error text 
The AI Help Desk must **not**: 
- Provide instructions for editing container images. - Suggest mounting files manually. - Provide docker or container engine commands. --- 
## 2. Slow Container Startup 
If container startup consistently exceeds the documented threshold (e.g., >90 seconds): - Ask user for: - Network conditions (e.g., VPN, local bandwidth issues). - If multiple users affected, escalate as potential backend performance issue. 
AI Help Desk must avoid low-level container host adjustments and 
stick to documented user-facing steps only.
