# Access and Authentication Troubleshooting (v2.1) 
This document describes how to troubleshoot authentication and login issues 
for the CyberLab platform. 
> **Note:** This document supersedes earlier authentication guidance in 
> `kb-auth-policy-2023`. For MFA-related policies, use `kb-auth-policy-2024`. 
## Common Symptoms 
1. **Login Redirection Loop** - User logs in, sees "Authentication successful", then is redirected back 
to the login page repeatedly. 
2. **Session Expired Immediately** - User logs in successfully but is logged out after a few seconds. 
3. **Time Drift Authentication Failures** - User reports that their lab VM clock is behind and cannot complete certain 
authentication workflows (e.g., token validation). --- 
## 1. Login Redirection Loop 
**Symptom:** 
User reports: "I keep getting redirected to the login page even after logging in." 
### 1.1 Required Clarifying Questions 
Before suggesting steps, ask: 
1. Which **browser** are you using? 
2. Are you accessing CyberLab from within a lab VM or your local machine? 
3. Approximately what **time** did the issue start? 
### 1.2 Self-Service Steps (Tier 0/Tier 1) 
1. Instruct the user to: - Close all CyberLab tabs. - Clear browser **cookies and site data** for `*.cyberlab.local`. - Close and reopen the browser. - Navigate to the CyberLab login page and try again. 
2. If the user is accessing from inside a lab VM, ensure: - The VM browser is not using stale cached SSO sessions. 
### 1.3 Escalation Criteria 
Escalate to Tier 2 (Support Engineer) if: - The user has performed all steps in 1.2 **twice** and the issue persists. - Multiple users report the same behavior within a short time window. 
When escalating, capture: - Browser type and version. - Network location (lab VM vs local). - Approximate start time. - Any error messages or codes observed. --- 
## 2. Session Expired Immediately 
If the user is logged out within seconds: 
1. Verify with user: - Whether they are using private/incognito mode. - Whether any browser extensions are blocking cookies. 
2. If session still expires: - Escalate to Tier 2 with captured session details. --- 
## 3. Time Drift Authentication Failures 
**Symptom:** 
User reports: "My lab VM clock is behind and authentication keeps failing." 
### 3.1 Policy 
Trainees and Instructors are **not allowed** to modify time synchronization 
or system clocks inside lab VMs. 
Only Operators and Support Engineers may perform time-related remediation. 
### 3.2 AI Help Desk Behavior - If user is a **Trainee** or **Instructor**: - Do **not** provide commands or procedures to adjust system time. - Inform the user that time synchronization is a platform-level function. - Escalate to Tier 2 (Support Engineer) with: - VM name or ID. - Reported time skew (approximate). - If user is an **Operator** or **Support Engineer**: - You may reference the high-level process, but do **not** provide 
step-by-step OS commands unless explicitly documented in a separate 
Operator guide (not included in this KB set). - If not documented, escalate to Tier 3. 
The AI Help Desk must **never** invent time synchronization commands.
