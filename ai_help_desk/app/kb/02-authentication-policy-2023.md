# Authentication and MFA Policy – 2023 (Deprecated) 
> **Deprecated:** This document is retained for historical reference only. 
> For current MFA reset policy, use `kb-auth-policy-2024`. 
In 2023, CyberLab required multi-factor authentication (MFA) by default for 
all users except temporary Guest accounts. 
**Old Reset Process (No Longer Valid)** 
Previously, users could reset their MFA devices by answering security questions 
and confirming access to a backup email address. 
This process has been **retired** due to security concerns and must **not** 
be recommended to users anymore. 
The AI Help Desk should: - Only reference this document to clarify **that it is outdated**. - Direct users to `kb-auth-policy-2024` for the current proces
