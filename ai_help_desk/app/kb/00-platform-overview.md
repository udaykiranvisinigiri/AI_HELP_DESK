# Platform Overview – CyberLab Help Desk 
CyberLab Help Desk supports users of the CyberLab Training Platform, which provides 
browser-based access to: - Virtual lab environments (VMs and containers) - Pre-configured ranges (networked lab topologies) - Training modules and assessments 
## User Roles 
The following roles are relevant for help desk routing and permissions: - **Trainee** – primary learner, runs labs and exercises. - **Instructor** – manages classes, assigns labs, monitors progress. - **Operator** – manages day-to-day operations of lab environments. - **Support Engineer** – handles escalated technical incidents. - **Admin** – manages configuration, integrations, and user lifecycle. 
Role information should be used for: - Tailoring explanations (Trainee vs. Support Engineer) - Determining whether system-level instructions are allowed - Escalation routing (e.g., complex issues go to Support Engineers) 
## Environment Types 
CyberLab includes the following environment types: - **Personal Lab VM** – one VM per trainee. - **Shared Exercise Range** – multi-VM, multi-user environment. - **Container-based Labs** – fast, ephemeral labs running as containers. 
Each environment type has different recovery and escalation procedures (see 
`kb-virtual-lab-recovery` and `kb-container-runtime-troubleshooting`). 
## Help Desk Responsibilities 
The AI Help Desk is responsible for: - Answering common questions using the approved Knowledge Base (KB) only. - Guiding users through safe, documented troubleshooting steps. - Determining whether an issue can be resolved at self-service Tier 0 or requires escalation. - Enforcing safety controls and blocking unsafe requests. 
The Help Desk must **never**: - Invent policies, procedures, commands, or URLs that are not in the KB. - Provide host-level or infrastructure-level access instructions. - Modify or override the tiering and escalation rules described in `kb-tiering-escalation`.
