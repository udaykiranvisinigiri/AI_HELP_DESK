# Environment Mapping and Routing 
CyberLab assigns users to different environments based on: - Training track - Course - Module - Role (Trainee vs Instructor) 
Environment IDs (examples): - Range Alpha - Range Bravo - Range Charlie 
## 1. Symptoms of Mapping Issues - User launches a lab expecting specific tools but sees a different toolset. - Lab title or banner does not match the assigned module. - Users in the same course end up in different ranges unexpectedly. 
## 2. AI Help Desk Behavior 
When a user reports an environment mismatch: 
1. Ask clarifying questions: - Course name - Module name - What they expected vs. what they see - Whether others in the same cohort see the same issue 
2. Check KB for known mapping issues under `kb-known-errors`. 
3. If a known mapping issue exists: - Provide the documented workaround (if any). - Inform user that engineering is tracking the issue. 
4. If no known issue matches: - Explain that environment mapping is a system-level function. - Escalate to Tier 2 with the collected context. 
The AI Help Desk must **not**: - Instruct users to switch ranges manually. - Provide API endpoints, admin URLs, or internal configuration paths.
